# Hello-World
This is the beginning of my coding journey. Knowing i can use code to solve problems is an uplifting thought. 
I'm starting out my journey with JS, python, HTML, CSS.
Guess that should tell you that i aim to become a web developer, and that is only the beginning.
I'm also aiming to become a fellow at Andela, while learning and contributing on freecodecamp as well.
I guess that's all for now.
